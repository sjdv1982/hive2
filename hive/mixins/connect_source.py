"""
Hives that are ConnectSourceBases can be used as the source argument in the connect command
They exist in two flavors:
- ConnectSource must have a _hive_connectable_source method, accepting a target ConnectTarget.
    The method must raise an informative HiveConnectError if the target is not connectable, nothing otherwise
    It must also have a _hive_connect_source method, invoked upon connection to the target
- ConnectSourceDerived must contain a _hive_connect_sources attribute
    This attribute must be a dict with string keys and ConnectSource values
