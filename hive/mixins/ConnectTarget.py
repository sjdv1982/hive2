"""
Hives that are ConnectTargetBases can be used as the target argument in the connect command
They exist in two flavors:
- ConnectTarget must have a _hive_connectable_target method, accepting a source ConnectSource.
  The method must raise an informative HiveConnectError if the target is not connectable, nothing otherwise
  It must also have a _hive_connect_target method, invoked upon connection to the source
- ConnectTargetDerived must contain a _hive_connect_targets class attribute
  This attribute must be a dict with string keys and ConnectTarget values
